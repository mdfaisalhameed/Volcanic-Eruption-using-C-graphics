# Volcanic Eruption Simulation Using C Graphics

## Description

This project aims to simulate a volcanic eruption using the graphical capabilities of the C programming language. The objectives are to visually represent a volcanic eruption, demonstrating the lava flow and ash cloud dispersion, while exploring the graphical functions available in C. The project highlights the methods and techniques used to create this simulation, including the initialization of graphics, drawing the volcano, animating the lava flow, and illustrating the smoke and ash clouds. The key findings show that it is possible to create an effective visual representation of a volcanic eruption using C's graphics library.
